**TECHNOLOGY STACK**
**Overview**

This project uses a simple and efficient technology stack suitable for a student-level web application. The selected technologies are easy to implement, widely used, and sufficient to demonstrate the system’s functionality.

**Frontend Technologies**

HTML: Used to structure the web pages.

CSS: Used to style the user interface and create a clean layout.

JavaScript: Used to handle user interactions and send requests to the backend.

Reason for choice:
These technologies are lightweight, beginner-friendly, and ideal for building simple and responsive web interfaces.

**Backend Technologies**

Python: Main programming language for backend development.

Flask: A lightweight Python web framework used to handle HTTP requests and application logic.

Reason for choice:
Flask is easy to learn, flexible, and suitable for small to medium-sized web applications.

**Machine Learning Component**

Python: Used to implement image classification logic.

Basic Image Classification Model or Simulated Logic: Used to classify issue type and severity.

Reason for choice:
A simple or simulated model is sufficient to demonstrate the concept of automated image-based classification for this project.

**Database**

SQLite: Used to store issue reports, image paths, predictions, and status updates.

Reason for choice:
SQLite is lightweight, easy to set up, and suitable for small-scale applications.

**Cloud Infrastructure**

Cloud-Based Architecture (Conceptual):
The system is designed to be cloud-ready, allowing image storage, processing, and scalability if deployed on a cloud platform.

Reason for choice:
This demonstrates an understanding of cloud-based system design without requiring full deployment.

**Summary**

The selected technology stack provides a balanced combination of simplicity, functionality, and scalability. It allows the system to meet project requirements while remaining manageable for a single developer.

# Smart Campus Facility Issue Reporting System

## Project Overview
The Smart Campus Facility Issue Reporting System is a web-based application designed to improve how facility issues are reported and managed within a university campus. Instead of using traditional methods such as emails or phone calls, students and staff can report issues by uploading an image and a short description.

The system uses image recognition techniques to automatically classify the type of issue and estimate its severity level. Maintenance staff can then view and manage reported issues through an administrative dashboard.


## Problem Statement
Many universities rely on manual and outdated methods to report campus facility problems, which leads to delayed repairs, poor tracking, and inefficient maintenance workflows. This project aims to address these challenges by providing a simple, fast, and transparent issue reporting system.


## Project Objectives
- Allow students and staff to report facility issues online  
- Enable image-based reporting for clearer issue identification  
- Automatically classify issues by type and severity  
- Improve maintenance response time and tracking
